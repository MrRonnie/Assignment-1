        <p>
          Everybody wants to be famous, but nobody wants to do the work.<br />
          I live by that. You grind hard so you can play hard. At the end of the
          day <br />
          you put all the work in, and eventually it'll pay off. It could be in
          a year <br />
          it could be in 30 years. Eventually, your hard work will pay off.

            The difference between successful people and really successful

          If we stop growing, technically and spiritually, we are as good as
          dead. Personal development is a major time-saver. The better you
          become the less time it takes you to achieve your goals

        <p>
          One of the marvelous things about community is that it enables us to
          welcome and help people in a way we couldn't as individuals. In some
          ways, programming is like painting. You start with a blank canvas and
          certain basic raw materials. You use a combination of science, art and
          craft to determine what to do with them
